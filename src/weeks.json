            "Week one flew by--but was not without moments that felt painfully long (fumbling through Git, navigating the Command Line, etc.). I expected to struggle, and to feel a little overwhelmed, but wasn't sure how I would struggle. That's where I've been living: swimming in questions I didn't know I needed to ask!", 
            "In some sense I feel like everything's a struggle (re: swimming in questions!). But specifically, I'm still tiptoeing my way around GitHub, poking around in the Command Line, and crossing my fingers that repo's magically appear!",
            "With the Command Line feeling a little more like home each day, I'm excited to continue uncovering its power. Beyond the CL, I'm eager to jump into html--the little bit I've picked up thus far has me itching to dive in deeper! (Specifically, how to make this text not run the length of the page!)"
